	"description": "Assorted RP Assets.\nIncludes bandage pieces as armour and accessory as needed.  \nA collection of weapons based on historical examples for various cultures\nA few warpaints.  \nAn expansion to weaponizing fortifications for tier 2 and 3 vanilla build sets as well (materials and mesh samples are not available for DLC etc.) \nSome miscellaneous items like hats, skirts, etc will appear.\nA roughly historical alchemy system as an alternate path to gold and dragon powder is also included, with pros and cons vs the vanilla systems.\nA few sizes of Roman style torsion catapultas (modern name Ballista) are included also.  They are siege weapons that do more to soft targets and less to hard targets than a trebuchet.\nList of current (out of date, I'll fix soon) items, cross referenced to Feat names here - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k3CGUriSEWeDNwLLKp2UEJ7iGPZgiP3K/view?usp=sharing\n \n\nDiscord https://discord.gg/h45bTeqNRs\n\nWeapons are *mostly* the same as my weapon pack, but \"balanced\" by giving them mostly the same stats as Star metal, and with the texture sets \"blinged\" up for the more fantasy settings.  I recommend against using both mods.\n\nThanks to Tuka and Slug for various assets, and to various people who have provided inspiration.  Thanks to Whiskey and Totchinuko for having APIs to use their accessory systems.  Also, heaps of thanks to all those who have helped out over the (cehcks notes, damn) years.  Mostly from the modding community. Bain has directed me towards solutions more often than he realizes. Xevyr I swear does most of everyone's coding.  But that might just be the view of coding that needs help.  It's still welcome and an impressive body of work.  And many others.  Most recently Juvilia for help with the &^&#$%$ing APEX thing.\n\nAccessories based on Whiskey's accessory system, big thanks to Whiskey for creating it, and letting others use it.  Accessory mod here https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2098700751\nWhiskey's Discord https://discord.gg/tAJZAjq\n\nSimilarly, the scabbards (and now ribbons) are intended for use with ToT! Custom or similar mods.  They won't on their own be useful, you would need a mod that allows items marked as weapons to show sheathed as accessories, and for that system to allow overlapping.  See https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2886779102\n\nAlso incorporates the Devious Desires Accessory API (which in turn depends on Whiskey's) to not conflict with their slots and possible (WIP) use some restraint tags for stump bandages.  See https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2300463941 for that mod, although it is not needed to be compatible, but will add immersion if I can get stump restraint working.\n\nOn mod load order.  To make this able to use ToT!Custom better, it uses the API.  To allow it to work without ToT!Custom loaded, it includes some assets from the API in the build, so should be loaded before ToT!Custom so anything there can overwrite the included assets in this pak.  With the Accesory wardrobe API, the game will use the API from the lowest/latest loading mod.  If you know which API version each has, then the latest API version last.\n\nLongsword Animations are (modified by me for the Conan skeleton) (C) Jakub Kisiel aka Kubold\n\nOphirian Plate Harness is (C) Countermarch on Fab Store\n\nA note on Feats.\nFor the cultural weapon packs, I've set prerequisite feats for the base star metal weapons the set uses.  EG, if a culture 'pack' includes bows and 2h swords, then it will require the epic bruiser and bows.  This means the game doesn't know how to place the feat in the feat tree.  To find them, look in the search.  The same goes for some of the other feats.\n\n[h2]Alchemy[/h2]\nThe alchemy recipes/feats are (loosely) based on real world pre-modern chemistry.  Some of the feats it might make sense for admins to block.  Below are the feat ID, Name, Explanation\n[table]\n[tr][td]22120001[/td][td]Leaching[/td][td]extracting saltpeter - precursor to most of the alchemy, but benign on it's own[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]22120003[/td][td]CrushFiltering[/td][td]getting lime, clay, etc, again, precursors, and benign on their own[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]22120004[/td][td]Nitre Alchemical Secrets (was Aqua Preparations)[/td][td]these are the nitric acid and saltpeter recipes, which includes a gold from goldstone extraction, throwable flasks of acid, and a different way of preparing dragon powder (basically black powder).  Obviously not 100% benign[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]22120002[/td][td]Sublimating[/td][td]for a single precursor, but didn't fit with anything else, salammoniac, benign on it's own.[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]22120026[/td][td]The Salty Alchemist[/td][td]A set of more precursor recipes, various salts.  Again, benign.[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]22120027[/td][td]Deeper Secrets of Alchemy[/td][td]This is the aqua Regis/regia recipes.  Making the stuff, disolving things, and condensing things out of it.  This includes efficient extraction of silver and gold from silverstone.  I doubt it's game breaking, but if a server economy relies on control of base game gold/silver, then allow with caution.[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]22120028[/td][td]Dragon Cotton[/td][td]separated out from Nitre shananigans so it can be blocked easier.  This is the more modern way of making boom.  Add Nitric acid to just about anything, rinse.  Creates Dragon Powder, named to take the mickey out of Gun Cotton (aka Nitrocellulose).  This recipe is greatly simplified, but still is a mid 17th century invention, so may not suit all games.  Still, the pre-modern game enabled ways of getting the aqua fortis may make this significantly more annoying a method than the existing in-game dragon powder recipes.  This also has the improved boom jar.  Much of the \"improvement\" is increasing damage slightly to structures, and a lot to people.  Messing with things that go boom, should do worse than a mild ache that goes away after a minute.[/td][/tr][/table]\n\nNames\nThe products have old timey names.  Saltpeter is still mostly called that, but common saltpeter or saltpetre is potasium nitrate.  Other types include sodium nitrate etc.  Always a nitrate.\nAqua Fortis is Nitric acid.  There are at least 20 names for this through the centuries.  The recipes I could find from old sources would yield at best, about 70% strength, so it would be significantly less dangerous than any modern pure stuff.  But still pretty nasty stuff.\nToxic Sludge is just a placeholder for \"things went wrong\".  You only try drinking it once.\nSal ammoniac is ammonium chloride\nAqua Regis is known by a few names, and is a mix of Nitric Acid and Hydrochloric. The combination will disolve \"noble metals\" like gold.  Which is why it gets names like regia/regis.\nOil of Virtiol is Sulphuric acid.  It's stinky and is a strong acid.\nBolus Alba is Kaolinite or an aluminium silicate.\nGreen Virtiol is iron sulphate\nCaustic Soda is, unsurprisingly, sodium hydroxide\nSoda Ash is Sodium carbonate (also known as washing soda, and soda crystals)\nLime is Calcium hydroxide, also known as hydrated lime, caustic lime, builders' lime, slaked lime, cal, and pickling lime.\n\n",
	"changeNote": "Removed MountTable adjustments for Spear and Longsword, replaced with a function over-ride on the visual blueprint for each weapoon.  Thanks Xevyr and Dr Nash, who didn't break this.\nResized some of the benches.  Anvils were a bit tall, saw horse was too large, dye bucket to small etc.\nTest of some modcontroller magic I was totally unfamiliar with regarding linking arrows to bows\nAdd a old worn out Ishtar releif (shamelessly copied from the one in the British Museum).  Future plans is to work on a not-half-destroyed version.\nUpdate ToT Custom API\n",
