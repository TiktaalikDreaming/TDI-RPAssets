	"description": "Assorted RP Assets.\nIncludes bandage pieces as armour and accessory as needed.  \nA collection of weapons based on historical examples for various cultures\nA few warpaints.  \nAn expansion to weaponizing fortifications for tier 2 and 3 vanilla build sets as well (materials and mesh samples are not available for DLC etc.) \nVarious items and 3d \"still life\" deco items will apear over time.  \n\nDiscord https://discord.gg/XEUZxZRVF9\n\nWeapons are *mostly* the same as my weapon pack, but \"balanced\" by giving them mostly the same stats as Star metal, and with the texture sets \"blinged\" up for the more fantasy settings.  I recommend against using both mods.\n\nThanks to Tuka for the dragon tattoo image\n\nAccessories based on Whiskey's accessory system, big thanks to Whiskey for creating it, and letting others use it.  Accessory mod here https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2098700751\nWhiskey's Discord https://discord.gg/tAJZAjq\n",
	"changeNote": "Removed a test blueprint that was blocked from inclusion in the build, but also a feat and material referenced by/for it, that were included.\nUpdating blood masks to custom masks rather than just one mask used across all weapons",
