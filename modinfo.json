	"description": "Assorted RP Assets.\nIncludes bandage pieces as armour and accessory as needed.  \nA collection of weapons based on historical examples for various cultures\nA few warpaints.  \nAn expansion to weaponizing fortifications for tier 2 and 3 vanilla build sets as well (materials and mesh samples are not available for DLC etc.) \nList of current items, cross referenced to Feat names here - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k3CGUriSEWeDNwLLKp2UEJ7iGPZgiP3K/view?usp=sharing\nVarious items and 3d \"still life\" deco items will apear over time.  \n\nDiscord https://discord.gg/XEUZxZRVF9\n\nWeapons are *mostly* the same as my weapon pack, but \"balanced\" by giving them mostly the same stats as Star metal, and with the texture sets \"blinged\" up for the more fantasy settings.  I recommend against using both mods.\n\nThanks to Tuka for the dragon tattoo image\n\nAccessories based on Whiskey's accessory system, big thanks to Whiskey for creating it, and letting others use it.  Accessory mod here https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2098700751\nWhiskey's Discord https://discord.gg/tAJZAjq\n\nA note on Feats.\nFor the cultural weapon packs, I've set prerequisite feats for the base star metal weapons the set uses.  EG, if a culture 'pack' includes bows and 2h swords, then it will require the epic bruiser and bows.  This means the game doesn't know how to place the feat in the feat tree.  To find them, look in the search.  The same goes for some of the other feats.\n\nAlchemy.  \nThe alchemy recipes/feats are (loosely) based on real world pre-modern chemistry.  Some of the feats it might make sense for admins to block.  Below are the feat ID, Name, Explanation\n22120001, Leaching, extracting saltpeter - precursor to most of the alchemy, but benign on it's own\n22120003, CrushFiltering, getting lime, clay, etc, again, precursors, and benign on their own\n22120004, Nitre Alchemical Secrets (was Aqua Preparations), these are the nitric acid and saltpeter recipes, which includes a gold from goldstone extraction, throwable flasks of acid, and a different way of preparing dragon powder (basically black powder).  Obviously not 100% benign\n22120002, Sublimating, for a single precursor, but didn't fit with anything else, salammoniac, benign on it's own.\n22120026, The Salty Alchemist, A set of more precursor recipes, various salts.  Again, benign.\n22120027, Deeper Secrets of Alchemy, This is the aqua Regis/regia recipes.  Making the stuff, disolving things, and condensing things out of it.  This includes efficient extraction of silver and gold from silverstone.  I doubt it's game breaking, but if a server economy relies on control of base game gold/silver, then allow with caution.\n22120028, Dragon Cotton, separated out from Nitre shananigans so it can be blocked easier.  This is the more modern way of making boom.  Add Nitric acid to just about anything, rinse.  Creates Dragon Powder, named to take the mickey out of Gun Cotton.  This recipe is greatly simplified, but still is a mid 17th century invention, so may not suit all games.  Still, the pre-modern game enabled ways of getting the aqua fortis may make this significantly more annoying a method than the existing in-game dragon powder recipes.",
