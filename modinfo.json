I recommend against using both mods.\n\nThanks to Tuka for the dragon tattoo image\n\nAccessories based on Whiskey's accessory system, big thanks to Whiskey for creating it, and letting others use it.  Accessory mod here https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2098700751\nWhiskey's Discord https://discord.gg/tAJZAjq\n",
