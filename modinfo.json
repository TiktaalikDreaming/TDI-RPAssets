Green, translucent, shiney, with knapped edges\nImprovised weapons added, sticks and smithing tools.  Sticks are mostly stolen whole-sale from my other mod, but match the stone tools for effectiveness (aka, shouldn't mess anyone's balance up)\nSome hidden (no recipes or feats) items I'm messing with",
